    'ceo-message-1' => "Volta Asia has been expanding into global markets for over 10 years. Each year, we strive to improve and make progress. The year 2020 marked an important milestone for us. Following a business restructuring, PNK decided to upgrade its compliance audits and regulatory licensing levels by submitting applications to European and American governments. PNK is also actively cooperating with regulatory authorities to calculate and increase margin guarantees and to process membership qualification reviews. This signifies a positive indicator for the growth trajectory of Volta Asia's business expansion plan and market coverage.",
    'ceo-message-2' => 'There are numerous forex service providers worldwide. Each year, Volta Asia witnesses many leaving the market while new providers join. Volta Asia has managed to survive and grow in this competitive market not only by offering professional services but also by supporting systematic trading strategies. Strategy support is our core competitive advantage. In 2017, Volta Asia transitioned from being a forex service provider to a strategy provider. The financial market encompasses many arbitrage strategies. PNK continuously conducts research and practical applications to build professional mathematical models and databases. When a trading strategy becomes widely used, its profit potential diminishes. Volta Asia can quickly retrieve new trading strategies from its database, ensuring its leading edge and consistently delivering profits to users.',
    'ceo-message-3' => 'After achieving success in hedge arbitrage, we introduced a new strategy—neutral arbitrage—in 2020, which we believe will yield even greater gains. Volta Asia has always been growing and actively maintaining its competitive edge. Within the next five years, PNK plans to establish PXX International Investment Bank. Volta Asia looks forward to sharing the dividends of growth with global investor',

    'overview-title' => 'What is Arbitrage?',
    'overview-desc' => 'Arbitrage mechanisms exist throughout capital markets. These mechanisms ensure relatively accurate pricing of financial products. However, when arbitrage mechanisms are absent, financial product prices can fluctuate significantly. A recent example is the substantial premium deviation of some tiered funds from their historical averages, which vividly demonstrates the importance of arbitrage as a cornerstone for financial product pricing.',
    'overview-subtitle' => 'Forex Arbitrage',
    'overview-subdesc' => 'In forex arbitrage, as long as transaction costs are lower than investment returns, arbitrage can continue indefinitely. Large investment firms often have low transaction costs in forex markets and strive to uncover and exploit such opportunities. Arbitrage mechanisms are the same across markets, whether involving the Swiss franc or the Japanese yen. Borrowing in low-yield currencies and investing in high-yield currencies depend on two main factors: currency volatility and low interest rates.',
    'overview-quote-1' => "According to Barclays Bank, based on data from the last 20 years, the annual average return of arbitrage trading strategies is 7.9%, ranking second among the top five strategies. Today, let's talk about foreign exchange arbitrage trading: arbitrage traders are key participants in the foreign exchange market, with the interbank market being the most significant. The majority of banks' assets are in currencies, and it is inevitable for them to use continuous arbitrage trading to ensure the yield of currencies. Institutional and individual speculators also actively engage in arbitrage trading for the same purpose.",
    'overview-quote-2' => 'Arbitrage refers to profiting from the buy-sell price difference caused by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In the early days of the foreign exchange market, arbitrage strategies were primarily based on exchange rate differences between countries due to regional and temporal factors.',
    'overview-quote-cite' => 'Barclays Bank',
    'overview-subtitle-2' => 'Types of Arbitrage Trading',
    'overview-subdesc-2' => 'There are many types of arbitrage trading, including the three most common ones: triangular arbitrage involving three currencies, carry trade, and covered arbitrage that leverages influence and predictive advantages.',
    'overview-subdesc-3' => 'With the development of computer technology, the "competition" between humans and computers has intensified. While most international foreign exchange traders still rely on subjective, manual trading methods, it is undeniable that the global trend increasingly favors using computers to execute trades. Quantitative trading is poised to become a key direction for future development.',
    'overview-subdesc-4' => 'At its core, finance is about identifying patterns from historical data in an attempt to predict the "most likely" outcomes. When it comes to analyzing patterns, nothing surpasses computers. The vast amounts of historical data and efficient processing capabilities give computers the foundation to excel. Quantitative trading is a method where computers sift through enormous datasets to identify high-probability events that generate excess returns, formulate strategies, and make decisions accordingly.',
    'overview-subdesc-5' => 'Quantitative trading eliminates human emotional factors. It acts like an unwavering, rational sword in the market, focused solely on delivering maximum efficiency and power.',
    
    'approach-title' => 'Volta Asia, how the trading team makes money by standing on the shoulders of giants',
    'approach-desc' => 'In arbitrage trading, markets are ever-changing, and no strategy works universally.

    'approach-subdesc' => 'Known as "standing on the shoulders of giants," neutral arbitrage contrasts with active investment by prioritizing objective, rational decision-making. The forex market is highly volatile, while human emotions—greed, fear, hesitation, recklessness—are inevitable weaknesses. These emotions often lead to poor decision-making. In contrast, quantitative trading operates without human interference once a model is deployed, minimizing emotional impacts and achieving rational, objective investments.',
